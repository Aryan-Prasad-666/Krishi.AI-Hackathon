  "disease": "Late blight",
  "plant": "Tomato",
  "symptoms": "Late blight on tomatoes presents as irregularly shaped, water-soaked lesions on leaves, often with white, cottony growth on the undersides, leading to fruit rot.",
  "remedies": "Prune infected leaves promptly and dispose of them properly. Apply copper-based fungicides preventatively, following label instructions. Ensure good air circulation by spacing plants adequately. Water plants at the base to avoid wetting foliage. Use resistant tomato varieties whenever possible. Regularly inspect plants for early signs of the disease. Apply a baking soda spray (1 tsp per quart of water) as a natural remedy. Remove and destroy all tomato plant debris at the end of the season. Consider using chlorothalonil or mancozeb fungicides for severe infections. Rotate crops annually to prevent soilborne inoculum buildup.",
