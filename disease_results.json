  "disease": "Late blight",
  "plant": "Tomato",
  "symptoms": "Large, irregular, dark water-soaked lesions develop on leaves and stems, often with white fuzzy growth, leading to firm brown fruit rot.",
  "remedies": "Plant certified disease-resistant tomato varieties. Ensure ample plant spacing for improved air circulation. Always avoid overhead watering; use targeted drip irrigation instead. Promptly remove and destroy all infected plant parts and debris. Implement strict crop rotation annually with non-solanaceous crops. Apply organic copper-based fungicides proactively. Use chemical fungicides like chlorothalonil or mancozeb according to label. Monitor plants diligently for initial signs of disease. Enhance soil drainage to prevent waterlogging around roots. Prune lower leaves to minimize soil splash and humidity.",
