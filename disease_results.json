  "disease": "Late blight",
  "plant": "Tomato",
  "symptoms": "Tomato leaves show large, dark, water-soaked lesions and fuzzy white mold, with fruits developing firm brown blotches.",
  "remedies": "Plant blight-resistant tomato varieties suitable for your region. Ensure adequate plant spacing to promote good air circulation. Water plants at their base in the morning, avoiding overhead irrigation. Practice strict crop rotation annually with non-solanaceous plants. Immediately remove and destroy all infected leaves, stems, and fruits. Apply approved organic copper-based fungicides as a preventative measure. Utilize conventional fungicides like chlorothalonil or mancozeb at first signs. Consider systemic fungicides for severe or widespread disease pressure. Improve soil drainage and manage weeds to reduce local humidity. Regularly monitor plants closely for any early symptoms of blight.",
