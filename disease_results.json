  "disease": "Late blight",
  "plant": "Tomato",
  "symptoms": "Tomato leaves develop water-soaked brown lesions that turn necrotic, with white fuzzy mold on undersides and rapid fruit rot.",
  "remedies": "Remove and destroy any infected leaves or fruit immediately. Apply a copper-based fungicide at label rates every 7\u201310 days. Use chlorothalonil or mancozeb systemic fungicide for high pressure. Spray a homemade potassium bicarbonate solution (1\u202ftsp per gallon) weekly. Apply neem oil or copper soap as a biocontrol barrier. Space plants 18\u201324 inches apart to improve airflow. Water at the base, avoiding overhead irrigation to keep foliage dry. Mulch with straw or black plastic to reduce soil splash. Rotate tomatoes with non\u2011solanaceous crops for at least three years. Scout daily and treat at first lesion signs.",
